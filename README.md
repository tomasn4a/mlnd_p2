# From the project description

As education has grown to rely more and more on technology, more and more data
is available for examination and prediction. Logs of student activities,
grades, interactions with teachers and fellow students, and more are now
captured through learning management systems like Canvas and Edmodo and
available in real time. This is especially true for online classrooms, which
are becoming more and more popular even at the middle and high school levels.
Within all levels of education, there exists a push to help increase the
likelihood of student success without watering down the education or engaging
in behaviors that raise the likelihood of passing metrics without improving
the actual underlying learning. Graduation rates are often the criteria of
choice for this, and educators and administrators are after new ways to
predict success and failure early enough to stage effective interventions,
as well as to identify the effectiveness of different interventions.

Toward that end, your goal as a software engineer hired by the local school
district is to model the factors that predict how likely a student is to pass
their high school final exam. The school district has a goal to reach a 95%
graduation rate by the end of the decade by identifying students who need
intervention before they drop out of school. You being a clever engineer
decide to implement a student intervention system using concepts you learned
from supervised machine learning. Instead of buying expensive servers or
implementing new data models from the ground up, you reach out to a 3rd party
company who can provide you the necessary software libraries and servers to
run your software.

However, with limited resources and budgets, the board of supervisors wants
you to find the most effective model with the least amount of computation
costs (you pay the company by the memory and CPU time you use on their
servers). In order to build the intervention software, you first will need to
analyze the dataset on students’ performance. Your goal is to choose and
develop a model that will predict the likelihood that a given student will
pass, thus helping diagnose whether or not an intervention is necessary.
Your model must be developed based on a subset of the data that we provide to
you, and it will be tested against a subset of the data that is kept hidden
from the learning algorithm, in order to test the model’s effectiveness on
data outside the training set.

Your model will be evaluated on three factors:
Its F1 score, summarizing the number of correct positives and correct
negatives out of all possible cases. In other words, how well does the model
differentiate likely passes from failures?
The size of the training set, preferring smaller training sets over larger
ones. That is, how much data does the model need to make a reasonable
prediction?
The computation resources to make a reliable prediction. How much time and
memory is required to correctly identify students that need intervention?
