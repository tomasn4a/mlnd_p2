    "**Pros**: SVC offers great flexibility since we can use an infinite set of kernel functions. In addition, SVM methods are very memory efficient since, once trained, they only look at a few support vectors, and predictions are very quick. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**: However one of its strengths is also one of its weaknesses: the choice of kernel functions being so vast it may be hard to come up with the good one. Sometimes domain knowledge can help us make an informed decission. But other times we may be limited to simply blindly try the standard kernel functions and choose the better performing. Another one of its disadvantages is its long training time. A brute force approach to finding the support vectors calculates the kernel function for every pair of points which can be time expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?**: We have a relatively modest dataset in terms of number of observation so we shouldn't turn away from SVC because of training cost. We have also split our factor variables into multiple dimensions and SVM tends to do well in these situations. Given the relative high number of features and the relatively small number of observations, SVC should be able to learn well from our data."

    "### Model 2: Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**: Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) is a simple and robust model that relies on Bayes' conditional probability rules and assumes conditional independance between the different variables. As such it is a simple model and a very quick learner. Even with the massive assumption of conditional independance, this model has been shown to work quite well in a variety of scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**: As with the previous model, one of its strengths is also one of its weaknesses. The assumption of conditional independence may not be correct for the problem at hand and by ignoring any possible relation between variables it may be hard to capture the nature of our data. In addition, the model offers no parameters to tweak, making it at the same time very straight-forward to use but with little flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?**: Given my limited knowledge of the subject under study, I am in no position to judge if the assumptions of this model are correct. But since it is not a very complex (in time and memory), it might give us a different baseline to compare other models too (it may even outperform them!)."

KNN is a lazy learning method, meaning that it does not learn directly from the training data and then uses the model learnt to make predictions but rather stores all training data in memory and only when asked to predict goes to that stored data to make the prediction. It predicts a class by looking at the classes of the K nearest (nearest being defined based on some measure, not necessarily the Euclidean distance) neighbors' classes and then figuring out our label either by simple \"voting\" or by some other form (for example weighted voting). Once again, our domain knowledge will help us determine what we mean by \"nearest\", and some knowledge of our training data structure will help us select a neighbor-finder algorithm. In general we can use the parameter K to play with variance and bias. By looking at the two extremes: when k=1 we look at just the closest point so the model has very high variance and will surely overfit. When k is very large, the model looks at too many points and so the model has high bias and cannot represent the complexity of the data. For now, we use the KNN \"out of the box\" that is with the default of k=5 and uniform weights:"

    "From the table above we can already draw a few conclusions and confirm some of our assumptions. First, we notice the expected and general trend that as the training set size increases, the error in the training set increases (the F1 score decreases). This is because with fewer points in the training set, the model tends to overfit it more, making the train error small but not generalizing well. The training and predicting times also agree with our intuition. The most expensive model is the SVC, as can be seen from its testing time. Both GNB and KNN have very small training times but for very different reasons: for GNB it steams from the model simplicity and assumptions, whereas for KNN it is because KNN is lazy. \n",
    "\n",
    "The results that are bit more difficult to interpret are the Test F1 scores. Let's look at the three models one by one. Starting with the **SVC** we see that actually we obtain the highest test F1 score when there are only 100 points in the training set. However, as it drops more than a point when increasing from 100 test points to 200, the trend is reversed when going from 200 to 300, increasing to almost the same level as before. \n",
    "\n",
    "For **GNB** we see the expected increase in test F1 score as we increase the number of training points, but then it drops sharply when n=300.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for **KNN** we also see the best score when n=100, and it goes down as the number of points goes up.\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe these are inconsistencies due to limited size of our dataset and the unnatured balanced of the labels (67% pass). We have a very limited dataset, under 400 ovservations for 44 features. In addition to that, we don't have a balanced number of \"pass\" and \"fail\". This can be a problem since, specially when the training set has 100 points and we have kept the test set fixed at 95 points, because of the random sampling we may find a case when most \"fail\" cases are lost, not belonging to the test nor the training set. We have verified this by changing the random seed in our train-test split. Changing the random seed alters dramatically the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the high number of features and the somehow limited number of points in our training set, and because its \"out of the box\" performance is pretty good, we will concentrate in improving the SVC classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "As explained above, Support Vector Machine models splits our data with hyperplanes in high dimensions. These hyperplanes are such that they maximize the margin between the classes split by the plane. It does such a thing by looking at Support Vectors, which are the points in each group which are closest to each other, while staying in their area. It is easy to visualize support vectors by imagining the two-dimensional case, with linearly separable data. In this case, the support vectors would be the points laying in the boundaries diving the two classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Classification (SVC) and other SVM methods allows for the use of different Kernel functions. Kernel functions can capture similarities in our data by projecting into different spaces (not necessarily with the same dimensions as our original space), where the data is actually separabe by hyperplanes. After transforming back to our original space, we may find the boundary is no longer linear. The choice or Kernel function represents our domain knowledge of the problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Sklearn's grid_search to estimate two parameters:\n",
    "* The kernel type: linear or RBF.\n",
    "* The C parameter which specifies how much to penalise misclassifications. A low C value will try to make the surface smooth, whereas a high C value tries to correctly classify as many training points as possible.\n",
    "* The class_weight parameter. By default, the model gives every point an equal weight of 1. By setting it to \"balanced\", \n",
    "* The gamma parameter. In RBF, the measure of similarity between two points takes the form $d(x,x') = exp \\left(-\\dfrac{||x-x'||^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right)$ which can also be expressed as $d(x,x') = exp(-\\gamma ||x-x'||^{2})$ by setting $\\gamma = \\dfrac{1}{2\\sigma^2}$. We see that it measures how \"fast\" the similarity drops from 1 when $x=x'$ to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our grid_search we will go beyond the standard three-fold CV and try a five-fold cross-validation. We will also use the F1 score as the scoring function. However we cannot use it as is, since it cannot identify the positive label and we cannot pass any arguments. So we'll make a scorer using make_scorer"
